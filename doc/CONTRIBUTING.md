It is warmly welcomed if you have interest to hack on sqlxb. First, we encourage this kind of willing very much. And here is a list of contributing guide for you.

* [Engage to help anything](#engage-to-help-anything)

## Reporting security issues

Security issues are always treated seriously. As our usual principle, we discourage anyone to spread security issues. If you find a security issue of sqlxb, please do not discuss it in public and even do not open a public issue. Instead we encourage you to send us a private email to  [8966188@gmail.com](mailto:8966188@gmail.com) to report this.

## Reporting general issues

To be honest, we regard every user of sqlxb as a very kind contributor. After experiencing sqlxb, you may have some feedback for the project. Then feel free to open an issue via [NEW ISSUE](https://github.com/x-ream/sqlxb/issues/new/choose).

Since we collaborate project sqlxb in a distributed way, we appreciate ***WELL-WRITTEN***, ***DETAILED***, ***EXPLICIT*** issue reports. To make the communication more efficient, we wish everyone could search if your issue is an existing one in the searching list. If you find it existing, please add your details in comments under the existing issue instead of opening a brand new one.

To make the issue details as standard as possible, we setup an [ISSUE TEMPLATE](./.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE) for issue reporters. Please ***BE SURE*** to follow the instructions to fill fields in template.

There are a lot of cases when you could open an issue:

* bug report
* feature request
* performance issues
* feature proposal
* feature design
* help wanted
* doc incomplete
* test improvement
* any questions on project
* and so on

Also we must remind that when filling a new issue, please remember to remove the sensitive data from your post. Sensitive data could be password, secret key, network locations, private business data and so on.

## Code and doc contribution

Every action to make project sqlxb better is encouraged. On GitHub, every improvement for sqlxb could be via a PR (short for pull request).

* If you find a typo, try to fix it!
* If you find a bug, try to fix it!
* If you find some redundant codes, try to remove them!
* If you find some test cases missing, try to add them!
* If you could enhance a feature, please ***DO NOT*** hesitate!
* If you find code implicit, try to add comments to make it clear!
* If you find code ugly, try to refactor that!
* If you can help to improve documents, it could not be better!
* If you find document incorrect, just do it and fix that!
* ...

Actually it is impossible to list them completely. Just remember one principle:
