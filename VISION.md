# xb Project Vision & Development Direction

**Post v1.0.0: Embracing Rapid Technological Iteration**

---

## 🎯 Core Vision

Empower Go developers to:
1. **Seamlessly switch** between relational databases (PostgreSQL/MySQL) and vector databases (Qdrant/pgvector)
2. **Unified API** for traditional queries and AI scenarios (RAG/vector search/hybrid queries)
3. **Stay simple** without drowning in technical complexity

---

## 🌊 Adapting to the Era of Rapid Tech Iteration

### Why No Fixed Roadmap?

In the AI/Vector DB era:
- **New technologies emerge monthly** (new vector databases, new ANN algorithms)
- **User needs evolve rapidly** (from RAG to Agent, from search to recommendation)
- **Best practices continuously evolve** (Embedding models, Chunking strategies)

**A fixed Roadmap would make us miss truly important opportunities!**

---

## 🧭 Development Principles (Unchanging)

### 1. Pragmatism First
- ✅ Solve **real problems**, not chase tech hype
- ✅ Prioritize **proven** technologies and patterns
- ✅ Keep API **simple** and **consistent**

### 2. Community-Driven
- ✅ Listen to user feedback and needs
- ✅ Welcome contributors to propose new directions
- ✅ Decide priorities through **Issues/Discussions**

### 3. Backward Compatibility
- ✅ v1.x series maintains API stability
- ✅ New features through **extension**, not **disruption**
- ✅ Deprecation requires clear migration paths

---

## 🔮 Potential Directions (No Commitment)

### Current Focus Areas

#### 1. Vector DB Ecosystem
- Emerging vector database support (Milvus / Weaviate / Pinecone)
- ANN algorithm optimization (IVF / HNSW parameter tuning)

## 📊 Decision Process

### How to Decide Whether to Adopt a New Feature?

```
Question 1: Is there a real user need?
           ↓ Yes
Question 2: Does it align with xb's core vision?
           ↓ Yes
Question 3: Will it break existing API?
           ↓ No
Question 4: Is there a community contributor willing to maintain it?
           ↓ Yes
           
✅ Adopt!

If any step is "No" → Discuss alternatives in Issue
```

## 🎓 Learning from AI Assistants

### Technology Research Process

When considering support for new technology:

1. **Ask AI Assistants**:
   ```
   "What are the most popular vector databases in 2025? What are their advantages?"
   "What are the latest best practices for RAG systems?"
   "What new algorithms and optimization techniques exist for Hybrid Search?"
   ```

2. **Verify Information**:
   - Check GitHub Star count and activity
   - Read official docs and benchmarks
   - Find real-world use cases in the community

3. **Quick Prototyping**:
   - Create example apps under examples/
   - Validate API design reasonableness
   - Collect community feedback

4. **Iterate & Optimize**:
   - Adjust API based on feedback
   - Improve docs and tests
   - Release new version

---

## 📅 Release Cadence

### Version Number Rules

- **v1.x.0** (Minor): New features, maintaining backward compatibility
  - New database support
  - New API extensions
  - Major performance optimizations

- **v1.x.y** (Patch): Bug fixes and minor improvements
  - Bug fixes
  - Documentation updates
  - Performance fine-tuning

- **v2.0.0** (Major): Major architectural changes (use caution!)
  - Incompatible API changes
  - Major architectural refactoring
  - Requires extensive community discussion

### Release Timing

**No fixed schedule**, but based on:
- ✅ Sufficient accumulated improvements
- ✅ Strong community demand
- ✅ Tests and docs are complete

## 🌟 Success Metrics

### How to Measure xb's Success?

**Not by GitHub Stars, but by:**

1. **Real Users**: How many production projects use it?
2. **Community Activity**: Quality and quantity of Issues/PRs/Discussions
3. **Ecosystem Richness**: How many third-party tools and integrations?
4. **Documentation Quality**: Can new users get started quickly?
5. **Technical Influence**: Does it advance best practices?

---

## 🚀 Next Steps (Open-Ended)

### Possible Directions (Depending on Community Feedback)

- [ ] **Milvus Support** (if user demand exists)
- [ ] **Performance Benchmarks** (if contributors propose)
- [ ] **GraphQL Integration** (if AI Agent scenarios need it)
- [ ] **Cloud-Native Tools** (if Kubernetes usage grows)
- [ ] **More AI Framework Integrations** (if new popular frameworks emerge)

**Priorities are determined by the community, not a preset Roadmap!**
