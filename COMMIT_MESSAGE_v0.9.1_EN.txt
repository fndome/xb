fix(core): Fix float64/int zero-value filtering and OR/AND sub-query handling

**Issues Fixed**:

1. **float64/int zero-value filtering failure**
   - `interface{} == 0` doesn't work for float64 types
   - Need type assertion before comparison: `v.(float64) == 0.0`
   - Fixed in `doGLE()` by separating each type case

2. **OR/AND sub-query rendering error in vector search**
   - `SqlOfVectorSearch` used simplified `buildConditionSql`
   - This method ignored `subs`, causing OR_SUB to render as `OR OR ?`
   - Fixed: Use correct `toCondSql()` instead

3. **OR_SUB using wrong connector**
   - OR_SUB (with subs) should use AND to connect with surrounding conditions
   - Pure OR operator (without subs) should use OR connector
   - Added `len(next.subs) > 0` check in `toCondSql`

4. **Pure OR/AND operators incorrectly filtered**
   - `orAndSub` previously filtered out all pure operators
   - Pure operators are needed to connect same-level conditions
   - Fixed: Only filter sub-queries containing *only* pure operators

**Changed Files**:

- `cond_builder.go`: Fixed zero-value filtering in `doGLE` and pure operator handling in `orAndSub`
- `to_sql.go`: Fixed OR_SUB connector logic
- `to_vector_sql.go`: Replaced simplified `buildConditionSql` with correct `toCondSql`

**Impact**:

✅ All existing tests pass
✅ Backward compatible
✅ Fixed critical bugs in the 9-layer auto-filtering mechanism

**Regression Tests**:

- `regression_test.go`: Added 6 regression tests
  - README example validation
  - float64/float32/int zero-value filtering
  - Vector search + And/Or combinations
  - API consistency validation
  - Empty And/Or cross-API validation
  - Nested And/Or tests
- `doc/TESTING_STRATEGY.md`: Testing strategy and improvement plan

**Root Cause Analysis**:

1. Test fragmentation: Vector search lacked combination tests
2. Incomplete type coverage: Missing float64/float32 tests
3. API consistency not validated: SqlOfSelect vs SqlOfVectorSearch behavior mismatch
4. Temporary implementation forgotten: buildConditionSql TODO not addressed

**Version**: v0.9.1
