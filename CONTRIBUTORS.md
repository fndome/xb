### v0.7.4 - Update Builder X() Method Enhancement (January 2025)

**Enhanced X() method for dynamic SQL expressions**

| Role | Contributor |
|------|-------------|
| **Feature Design** | sim-wangyan |
| **Implementation** | sim-wangyan |

Key improvement: `X()` method now supports parameterized expressions with automatic nil/0 handling.

### v0.7.0-v0.7.3 - Core Framework

**Original sqlxb framework**

| Role | Contributor |
|------|-------------|
| **Framework Design** | sim-wangyan (x-ream) |
| **Core Implementation** | sim-wangyan |
| **Bb Abstraction** | sim-wangyan |

The excellent foundation that made AI-First development possible.

## 🌟 Special Recognition

### The Bb (Building Block) Design

The `Bb` struct designed in 2020 proved to be a **perfect abstraction**:

```go
type Bb struct {
    op    string
    key   string
    value interface{}  // Extreme flexibility
    subs  []Bb         // Recursive structure
}
```

**Validation**: Vector database support (2025) required **zero changes** to Bb.

This demonstrates:
- ✅ Excellent abstraction design
- ✅ Forward-thinking architecture
- ✅ Stands the test of time

**Credit**: sim-wangyan (original designer, 2020)

### AI-First Development Model

sqlxb v0.8.0 proves that:

```
AI can:
✅ Design complex features
✅ Implement production-quality code
✅ Write comprehensive tests
✅ Create extensive documentation
✅ Maintain framework code

Human should:
